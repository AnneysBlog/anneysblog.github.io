        <h1>Anney at the DSSQ</h1>
        <p>In November of last year, the far-right, xenophobic AFD party organised a secret meeting in Potsdam, Germany, where they discussed some far-right plans ad opinions.
            This caused many political protests all over the country, organised by people like myself, who will suffer under an AFD-government.
            <br>
            One of those cities was Düsseldorf, my hometown. Of coarse I went there! <br>
            This protest was organised by DSSQ (Düsseldorf stellt sich queer) and took place on the 27th of January.
            The police expected 30.000 people... Well, it ended up being over 100.000 (1/3 of the city population!). <br>
            <b>We won't let those xenophobic half-nazis grind us down.</b>
            <br>
